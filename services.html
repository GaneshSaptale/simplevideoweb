                    In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. 
                    A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). </p>

                <p>  particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long.  Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea.
                    In this handout, we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph.
